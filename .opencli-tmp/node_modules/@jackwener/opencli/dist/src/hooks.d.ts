/**
 * Plugin lifecycle hooks: allows plugins to tap into opencli's execution lifecycle.
 *
 * Hooks use globalThis (like the command registry) to guarantee a single shared
 * instance across all module copies — critical when TS plugins are loaded via
 * npm link / peerDependency symlinks.
 *
 * Available hooks:
 *   onStartup        — fired once after all commands & plugins are discovered
 *   onBeforeExecute  — fired before every command execution
 *   onAfterExecute   — fired after every command execution (receives result)
