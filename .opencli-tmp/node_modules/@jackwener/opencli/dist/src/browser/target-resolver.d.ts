/**
 * Unified target resolver for browser actions.
 *
 * Resolution pipeline:
 *
 * 1. Input classification: all-digit → numeric ref path, otherwise → CSS path.
 *    The CSS path passes the raw string to `querySelectorAll` and lets the
 *    browser parser decide what's valid. No frontend regex whitelist — the
 *    goal is that any selector accepted by `browser find --css` is accepted
 *    by the same selector on `get/click/type/select`.
 * 2. Ref path: cascading match levels (see below), using data-opencli-ref
 *    plus the fingerprint map populated by snapshot + find.
 * 3. CSS path: querySelectorAll + match-count policy (see ResolveOptions)
 * 4. Structured errors:
 *    - numeric: not_found / stale_ref
 *    - CSS:     invalid_selector / selector_not_found / selector_ambiguous
 *               / selector_nth_out_of_range
 *
 * All JS is generated as strings for page.evaluate() — runs in the browser.
 *
 * ── Cascading stale-ref (browser-use style) ──────────────────────────
 * Strict equality on the fingerprint rejected too many live pages — SPA
 * re-renders swap text / role while keeping id + testId. The resolver
 * now walks three tiers before giving up:
 *
 *   1. EXACT        — tag + strong id (id or testId) agree, ≤1 soft mismatch
 *   2. STABLE       — tag + strong id agree, soft signals drifted (aria-label,
 *                     role, text) — agent gets a warning but the action
 *                     proceeds so dynamic pages don't stall
 *   3. REIDENTIFIED — original ref either missing from the DOM or fully
 *                     mismatched, but the fingerprint uniquely identifies
 *                     a single other live element via id / testId /
 *                     aria-label. Re-tag that element with the old ref and
 *                     surface match_level so the caller knows we swapped.
 *
 * Only when all three fail do we emit `stale_ref`. Every success envelope
 * carries `match_level` so downstream CLIs can surface the weakest tier
 * a caller actually traversed.
