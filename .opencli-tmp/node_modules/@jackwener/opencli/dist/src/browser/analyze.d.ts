/**
 * `browser analyze <url>` — turn site-recon guesswork into deterministic CLI output.
 *
 * When an agent starts a new adapter, the first question is "which pattern am
 * I looking at?" (A/B/C/D/E from site-recon docs) and "will Node-side fetch
 * work, or will anti-bot middleware block me?". Today the agent has to open
 * the page, poke `network`, try cURL, fail, guess again. This module condenses
 * that into one call that returns a classification + evidence.
 *
 * Kept pure (no page imports) so the bulk is unit-testable; the CLI wrapper
 * drives a real page, feeds the resulting signals here, and prints the verdict.
