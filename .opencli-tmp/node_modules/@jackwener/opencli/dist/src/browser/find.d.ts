/**
 * `browser find --css <sel>` — structured CSS query.
 *
 * Returns every match of a selector as a JSON envelope agents can read
 * without parsing free-text snapshot output. Each entry carries two
 * identifiers — a numeric `ref` (matching the snapshot contract) and a
 * stable 0-based `nth` — so the agent can act on a specific result via
 * either path:
 *
 *   browser click <ref>              // when ref is numeric
 *   browser click "<sel>" --nth <n>  // always works
 *
 * Refs are *allocated on the spot* for matched elements that were not
 * tagged by a prior snapshot: `data-opencli-ref` is set on the element
 * and a fingerprint is written into `window.__opencli_ref_identity`
 * (same shape the snapshot uses). That makes `find` a first-class entry
 * point to the ref system — agents can skip running `browser state`
 * when they already know the selector.
 *
 * Attributes are whitelisted to keep output small and high-signal.
 * Invisible elements are still returned so agents can reason about
 * offscreen vs truly-missing targets.
 *
 * When a matched element is a compound form control (date-like input,
 * select, file input), the entry gains a `compound` field with the
 * rich view from `compound.ts`. This is what kills the three biggest
 * agent-fail modes on form pages (wrong date format, guessed options,
 * re-uploaded files) without forcing agents to probe further.
