/**
 * Build-time CLI manifest compiler.
 *
 * Scans all JS CLI definitions in clis/ and pre-compiles them into a single
 * manifest.json for instant cold-start registration.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx src/build-manifest.ts [--allow-removals[=N]]
 *
 * Output: cli-manifest.json next to clis/
 *
 * Safety invariants:
 *   - Adapters whose source file does not call `cli(...)` are silently
 *     skipped (they are helpers / type modules, not commands).
 *   - Adapters that look like commands but fail to import are reported as
 *     failures, the manifest is NOT written, and the process exits 1. This
 *     prevents a stale dist or a broken adapter from silently dropping
 *     other adapters' entries (root cause of the "manifest lost 478 lines"
 *     incident).
 *   - Net-deletions vs the existing committed manifest abort the build by
 *     default; pass `--allow-removals=N` (or just `--allow-removals` for any
 *     amount) to confirm an intentional removal.
