 * Commander adapter: bridges Registry commands to Commander subcommands.

 * 1. Commander arg/option registration
 * 2. Collecting kwargs from Commander's action args
 * 3. Calling executeCommand (which handles browser sessions, validation, etc.)
 * 4. Rendering output and errors
 *
 * All execution logic lives in execution.ts.
